# Bootcamp Prework Study Guide

## Description

The purpose of this project is to provide a study guide of the material I learned in the Prework section of the U of U Coding Bootcamp for future reference. I also made it to practice using HTML, CSS, Git, and Java Script for the first time. This project taught me the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, Java Script, and making a website.

This site is meant to be used to review notes of the four sections of the Coding Bootcamp Prework. If the user needs a suggestion on what to study, they can open Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). This will open the console and allow the user to see a suggestion of which topic they should study first.
